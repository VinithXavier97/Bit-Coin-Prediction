# Forecasting Bitcoin Prices using Deep Neural Networks.
Project based learning is the methodology in which projects drive knowledge and is used in dedicated subjects without negotiating the coverage of the required technical material. This paper discusses the scheme and delivery of project based learning in computer science engineering as major project which adopts undergraduate creativities and emphasizes on real-world, open-ended projects. These projects foster a wide range of abilities, not only those related to content knowledge or technical skills, but also practical skills. The goal for this innovative undergrad project is to show how a trained machine model can predict the price of a cryptocurrency if we give the right amount of data and computational power. It displays a graph with the predicted values. The most popular technology is the kind of technological solution that could help mankind predict future events. With vast amount of data being generated and recorded on a daily basis, we have finally come close to an era where predictions can be accurate and be generated based on concrete factual data. Furthermore, with the rise of the crypto digital era more heads have turned towards the digital market for investments. This gives us the opportunity to create a model capable of predicting crypto currencies primarily Bitcoin. This can be accomplished by using a series of machine learning techniques and methodologies.
